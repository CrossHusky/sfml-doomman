# sfml-doomman

This is a Doom themed variant of the famous arcade game "PAC-MAN", opensource and with high customization capacities.

Works with GNU GCC, Microsoft VC++ and LLVM Clang.

It was built using SFML and STL.

This repo provides the essential files in order to run DOOM-MAN on any platform.
MenuState and GameState have music integration although it is kinda poor, I'd like to implement a sound manager. 
Levels can be edited at user comfort.
Textures can be edited too but it is kinda dificult.
